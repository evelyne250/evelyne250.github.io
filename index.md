## Twitter User Segmentation & Mining

Twitter is an American microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact with messages known as "tweets". Registered users can post, like, and retweet tweets, but unregistered users can only read them as defined by Wikipedia.
Twitter allows us to get developer access which can allow us to do data analysis using Twitter api. To be able to extract data from the twitter api you should first create a developer account on the Twitter apps site, Then log in after that you will need to create an app so as to be able to get the consumer key, consumer secret, access key and access secret which will help you in Authentication.

### Installation

To use Tweepy you should first install it using pip and import other necessary modules:
